# Coding Games: Problem-Solving Games for Learning Coding

## Project Description
Coding Games is a blockchain-based platform that gamifies coding education. Creators can design coding challenges, deposit a reward pool, and review participants' submissions. Learners participate by solving coding problems and submitting their solutions. If their solutions are approved, they receive the reward. This system incentivizes learning and problem-solving while ensuring transparency and fairness.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to make coding education more interactive, rewarding, and accessible by combining blockchain technology with gamified learning. By providing an engaging environment for learning, we aim to bridge the gap between beginners and coding mastery.

## Key Features
- **Create Coding Challenges**: Game creators can design challenges with a title, description, and an initial reward pool.
- **Submit Solutions**: Participants can submit solutions to active games for review.
- **Reward Distribution**: Upon approval of a submission, the reward is automatically transferred to the participant.
- **Transparency and Trust**: All interactions, including submissions and approvals, are recorded on the blockchain for verifiability.
- **Game Lifecycle Management**: Games automatically deactivate after the reward is claimed, preventing misuse.


## Future Enhancements
- **Leaderboard**: Add a leaderboard to track top participants and game creators.
- **Multi-token Support**: Support multiple cryptocurrencies for reward pools.
- **Collaborative Challenges**: Enable group submissions for team-based challenges.
- **Automated Solution Review**: Integrate AI for automatic code evaluation to reduce manual effort.
